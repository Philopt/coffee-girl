While reviewing the dog handling code we searched for references to dogs not being properly cleaned up. `cleanupDogs` already removes dogs associated with known customers and destroys any sprite that travels well past the screen edges. However stray dogs that sit just outside the 480px wide play area were not reported. A log statement has been added to `cleanupDogs` when `DEBUG` is enabled so we can see if any invisible or off-screen dogs remain.

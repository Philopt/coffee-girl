# Coffee Clicker

Coffee Clicker is a small browser game built with [Phaser](https://phaser.io/). Serve coffee, earn tips and try to keep your customers happy.

## Getting Started

1. Run a simple local HTTP server:

   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server
   ```

   Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

   The game must be accessed via `http://` either locally or on any static host. Opening `index.html` directly will not load all assets correctly.

The game uses Phaser via the CDN:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/phaser@3/dist/phaser.min.js"></script>
```

Have fun clicking!
